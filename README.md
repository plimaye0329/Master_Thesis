## Repository to host data and scripts from Master Thesis:
This repository is a clone of my Master's Thesis files. The repo consists of FRB20240114A burst archives from the Ultra BroadBand Receiver on Effelsberg. The python scripts are used to extract and visualize the broadband burst spectra.

The scripts here can only visualize sub-band bursts. To visualize bursts over the entire UBB frequency range, refer to: https://github.com/plimaye0329/FRB_Tools/tree/main/FRB-UBER

For further queries regarding colaborating and utilising this data, contact me at limaye@mpifr-bonn.mpg.de
